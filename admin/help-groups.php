<h5>Groups</h5>
<p>Groups in Campaign Press store Access &amp; Billing information for Campaign Monitor.  I.e. How much to charge per campaign, how much of Campaign Monitor can clients use etc.</p>
<p>Because of the limitations of the Campaign Monitor API (as at 13 October 2010), only groups that have no clients assigned to them can have their access &amp; billing details changed.  These groups may only change their name &amp; description.  They cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>Groups without any clients assigned to them may be deleted &amp; may have any of their details modified.</p>
